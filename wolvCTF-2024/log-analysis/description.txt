Hi there incident responder. So we have this company that was breached sometime last week, but their SOC team only keeps HTTP request logs :( We took down all of our wolvsecsolutions websites as a precaution.

Maybe there's still a way to figure out what happened? Why did they click on a suspicious link? Somebody told me there's a flag on the link now?
